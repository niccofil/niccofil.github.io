            <h6>The Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius</h6>
            <p> Stoicism originated as a Hellenistic philosophy, founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium (modern day Cyprus), 
                c. 300 B.C.E. It was influenced by Socrates and the Cynics, and it engaged in vigorous debates with the Skeptics, 
                the Academics, and the Epicureans. The name comes from the Stoa Poikile, or painted porch, an open market in Athens 
                where the original Stoics used to meet and teach philosophy. Stoicism moved to Rome where it flourished during the period of the Empire, 
                alternatively being persecuted by Emperors who disliked it (for example, Vespasian and Domitian) and openly embraced by Emperors who attempted 
                to live by it (most prominently Marcus Aurelius). It influenced Christianity, as well as a number of major philosophical figures throughout the ages 
                (for example, Thomas More, Descartes, Spinoza), and in the early 21st century saw a revival as a practical philosophy associated with Cognitive Behavioral 
                Therapy and similar approaches. Stoicism is a type of eudaimonic virtue ethics, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient 
                to achieve happiness (in the eudaimonic sense).
            <br>
                However, the Stoics also recognized the existence of “indifferents” (to eudaimonia) 
                that could nevertheless be preferred (for example, health, wealth, education) or dispreferred (for example, sickness, poverty, ignorance), 
                because they had (respectively, positive or negative) planning value with respect to the ability to practice virtue. Stoicism was very much a 
                philosophy meant to be applied to everyday living, focused on ethics (understood as the study of how to live one’s life), which was in turn 
                informed by what the Stoics called “physics” (nowadays, a combination of natural science and metaphysics) and what they called “logic” 
                (a combination of modern logic, epistemology, philosophy of language, and cognitive science).
